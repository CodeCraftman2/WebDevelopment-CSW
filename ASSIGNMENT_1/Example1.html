<h2>First Section</h2>
<p>“There is a thriving artist community on Twitch, and this policy was overly punitive and did not reflect the impact of the content,” the company said in a blog post Wednesday.</p>
<h2>Second Section</h2>
<p>To be clear, Twitch still does not permit streamers to be fully or partially nude. But it is now allowing content that “deliberately highlight[s] breasts, buttocks or pelvic region” as well as “body writing” and body painting on “female-presenting breasts and/or buttocks regardless of gender” with a Sexual Themes label. In addition, dances such as “twerking, grinding and pole dancing” are now allowed without a label.</p>
<h2>Third Section</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, there’s no change to Twitch’s policy concerning games “featuring nudity, pornography, sex or sexual violence as a core focus or feature” — those remain entirely prohibited. For games in which nudity is not the core focus or feature, the Mature-Rated Games Content Classification label is sufficient for incidental nudity.</p>
<h2 id="4">Fourth Section</h2>
<p>Angela Hession, Twitch’s chief customer trust officer, explained in a blog post that the livestreaming platform was making the updates after receiving “consistent feedback from streamers that our current policies around sexual content are confusing and that it can be difficult to know how their content will be interpreted based on these policies.”</p>
<h2>Fifth Section</h2>
<p>According to Twitch, if streamers fail to use a Content Classification Label accurately, they will receive warnings and “the correct CCL will be applied by Twitch to the stream,” the company says. If streamers fail to apply the correct CCL repeatedly, a label will be temporarily locked onto the stream but it will not result in a suspension.</p>

<p>Throughout past seasons of Netflix’s “The Crown,” Queen Elizabeth II’s sister, Princess Margaret, is depicted mainly as the life of any party. The charming and witty royal, so far portrayed by actors Vanessa Kirby and Helena Bonham Carter, can be seen winning over every audience — often with a gin and tonic in one hand and a smoldering cigarette in the other.

    How much Margaret’s habits contributed to her health struggles later in life has long been discussed among those who knew her well.

    Last season of “The Crown” left viewers with the impression of an ill-at-ease princess who enjoyed her drink but also began seeking treatment for depression. Season 5 will peer into this later half of Princess Margaret’s life with Lesley Manville portraying her.

    With the latest season debuting, here is everything to know about the princess’s health in the lead-up to her death and the details around her final days.</p>

<p>"Of course, the princess grew up in an age where drinking and smoking was much more acceptable," a friend explained. "We all did. However, I don’t believe she was addicted to alcohol. It’s preposterous. She just got very used to it."</p>
